- `./data/raw/12-20-google-dns`: This directory offers files for per-probe monthly RTT measurements to Google Public DNS resolvers from RIPE Atlas probes in the LACNIC region since 2014 (measurement ID: 1591146).

#### Processed data

- `./data/processed/02-addr-space/02-addr_space_ve.csv.gz`: This file includes data on the address space allocated to Venezuela, detailing the space announced by each provider.
- `./data/processed/06-16-chaos-txt`: Contains files with locations of Root DNS servers inferred from DNS CHAOS TXT measurements. These measurements were conducted using RIPE Atlas probes in Venezuela since 2016.
- `./data/processed/07-hgs`: This directory holds data on _off-nets_ inferred to be in Venezuela obtained from the artifacts offered by Gigis et al. ( SIGCOMM 2021).
- `./data/processed/12-google-dns`: Stores the mean and median Round-Trip Time (RTT) latency values to Google Public DNS resolvers from RIPE Atlas probes in the LACNIC region since 2014 (measurement ID: 1591146).
- `./data/processed/12-stable-set`: Similar to the previous dataset but includes only measurements from probes that participated in at least 90% of the measurements, providing a stable set of RTT latency data.
- `./data/processed/17-ripe-probes`: Contains monthly data on the count of RIPE Atlas probes in each country within the LACNIC region.
- `./data/processed/19-third-party-providers`: Offers an analysis of the adoption of third-party providers in topsites across Latin American countries.

#### External data
